# FPS MEGAGAME JAM
*3 hours to make a first-person shooter?! Easy!* 😅

## 🕘 The Challenge 🕛

You are to work with your peers to create an FPS MEGAGAME! You will use this GitHub repo and collaborate using Git version control to implement game modifications into a "completed" game. The provided project contains a fully playable game, including multiple pickups, weapons, enemies, and levels. We'll go through some collaboration basics and the project structure before we begin.

You will only have three hours to complete this, including the introduction to the task, development of your modifications, testing of the game, bug-fixing, and publishing. Therefore, planning is critical!

The biggest things you are striving to achieve here are not only related to the finished game, but of experiencing a semi-structured rapid-fire ideation and creation process.

We'll build the completed game with everybody’s assets in it by the end of class and publish it too!

## 📚 Learnings 📚

During the jam, you'll explore Unity’s FPS Microgame template project and see how it is put together, develop (and see your peers developing) new/custom pickups, weapons, enemies, and levels (including their implementation into a “completed” game), engage in remote game development using Git version control, playtest your game to confirm that it is working as intended, and deploy it on itch.io.

## 💟 Your Task 💟

Each group member is to implement each of the following into/throughout one of the game's levels:
* A modified enemy variant
* A modified pickup variant
* A modified weapon variant
* A new level, populated with variants made by you and your group members

For each of your variants, you are to go through CONCEPT, DEVELOP, and IMPLEMENT phases. Share screenshots of each stage as you go.

## ⭐ Success Criteria ⭐

* I can collaborate remotely with group members to conceptualise, develop, and implement new game elements into a completed game project.
